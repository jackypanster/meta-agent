# MVP Validation Checklist

## Success Criteria Validation

### 1. End-to-End Dialogue ✓
- [ ] Start the application
- [ ] Have a multi-turn conversation
- [ ] Verify intent recognition works
- [ ] Confirm natural responses

### 2. Tool Invocation ✓
- [ ] Ask "What's the weather in Beijing?"
- [ ] Verify Context7 tool is called
- [ ] Confirm correct results returned

### 3. Memory Validation ✓
- [ ] Say "My name is Zhang San"
- [ ] Ask "What's my name?"
- [ ] Verify correct name is returned

### 4. Environment Setup ✓
- [ ] Clone fresh repository
- [ ] Run setup commands from README
- [ ] Verify app starts successfully
- [ ] Count commands (must be ≤ 3)

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure first response time
- [ ] Verify < 3 seconds (excluding network)

## Error Handling
- [ ] Test with invalid API key
- [ ] Test with network disconnection
- [ ] Verify graceful error messages
```

# Test Strategy:
1) Run automated E2E tests to verify all success criteria, 2) Perform manual testing following the validation checklist, 3) Test performance requirements with timing measurements, 4) Verify error handling and recovery, 5) Validate the complete user journey from setup to conversation
